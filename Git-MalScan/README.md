A Python script to **automatically search GitHub for `.exe, .com, .pif, .msi, .scr, .bat, .cmd, .dll, .sys, .drv, .ocx, .vbs, .js, .ps1, .hta, .wsf, .lnk, .sh, .py, .zip, .rar, .7z, .tar, .gz, .iso, .docm, .xlsm, .pptm, .apk, .jar` files**, download them, and scan them for malware using [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) and [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/). Results are logged and malicious files are saved for further analysis.

# MalScanV4.py uses ClamAV and Virus Total for detection
# MalScanV4VT.py uses Virus Total Exclusively

## Features

- Searches GitHub repositories for `.exe, .com, .pif, .msi, .scr, .bat, .cmd, .dll, .sys, .drv, .ocx, .vbs, .js, .ps1, .hta, .wsf, .lnk, .sh, .py, .zip, .rar, .7z, .tar, .gz, .iso, .docm, .xlsm, .pptm, .apk, .jar` files using the GitHub API.
- Should Comply with API Limits for Virus Total.
- Downloads and scans each file with ClamAV.
- Then scans files with VirusTotal (API key required, respects rate limits).
- Maintains blocklists to avoid reprocessing the same files or repositories.
- Has extensive verbose mode, can choose wether you want to see the verbose when starting a scan.
- Allows for setting recursive search depth
- You can specify up to 30-100 for search query at the moment, however this searches three filters so you'll likely get around 300 repos to search
- Allows for setting a keyword to search for, IE: Roblox Hacks, and it will filter only from this topic
- Designed for use on a Raspberry Pi or Linux system with SSD storage.
- Automatically installs missing Python dependencies.
- Automatically logs the source address to a file inside a folder containing the binary, allows for easier reporting.
- Streams scan events into TimescaleDB when Postgres credentials are supplied via `.env`.
---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) installed and available in your PATH
- A [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` access
- A [VirusTotal API key](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us) (optional, but recommended)
- Linux system (uses `/mnt/ssd` and `nice` command; adjust for other OSes as needed)

---

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository or download the script:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Net-Zer0/MalScan.git
    cd malscan.py
    ```

2. **Install ClamAV:** -If you are using V3.1VT, you may skip this step!

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install clamav
    ```

3. **Edit the script:**

    - Replace the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `VT_API_KEY` variables at the top of the script with your own keys.
    - You can create a token in the developer section of Githubs settings for your account, create a new personal one and copy that and use it in the script, However I must empathize you must never share this!!!

4. **(Optional) Adjust directories:**

    - By default, the script uses `/mnt/ssd` for storage and `/tmp/git_scan` for temporary files. Change these if needed.
5. **(Non Optional) Adjustment to directories:**
    - ALSO more importantly change the def mount portion `def mount_ssd():` where  `/dev/sda3` is defined, this needs to be set to your drive to work, IE: SSD or USB etc. using **lsblk** can find your mount point!
    - ***THIS STEP IS CRUCIAL TO THE SCRIPT WORKING AND REQUIRES SOME KNOWLEDGE OF PYTHON!!!***

6. **(Optional) Adjust the search query to include other file types**
   `SEARCH_QUERY = "extension:exe OR extension:dll OR extension:scr OR extension:bat OR extension:cmd OR extension:js OR extension:vbs OR extension:ps1 OR extension:msi OR extension:com OR extension:jar"
SEARCHES = [
    {"desc": "fewest stars", "sort": "stars", "order": "asc"},
    {"desc": "newly indexed", "sort": "indexed", "order": "desc"},
    {"desc": "recently updated", "sort": "updated", "order": "desc"},
]`
- you can pretty much change or add any scannable file type to `extensions:X OR extension:X` meaning you can easily add more to the scope by tweaking it until I add more to the base script!
---

## Usage

Run the script with Python 3:

```sh
sudo python3 MalScanV4.py or MalScan4VT.py
```
--- 
## TimescaleDB Ingestion
- Run the DDL in `schema.sql` against your TimescaleDB database so the required tables and hypertables exist.
- Provide `POSTGRES_USERNAME`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DATABASE`, `POSTGRES_HOSTNAME`, and `POSTGRES_PORT` (for example via `.env`). The script loads these on startup.
- When credentials are present the scanner streams repository checks and per-file scan results into TimescaleDB using the `MalScanV4` ingestion pipeline.
- If any credential is missing or the connection fails, ingestion is skipped and the scanner continues to operate locally.

## Recommendations - For Running On PI or Linux SBC
I would recommend if you are using Raspbian to use the 64bit version and run it in lite as we will be using the command line exclusively. I would also recommend if you want to run it for long periods of time to use `tmux new -s scan` or some other alternative like `screen` to keep the process running if you are using SSH, this will allow you to come back and reattach to the program when leaving it unattended if you do not have a monitor and keyboard to run it as it's own workstation. among other things I am investigating freezing issues with ClamAV on my 3B+, however I'm fairly certain this is due to undervoltage on my part. when I figure that out I may make ClamAV scan with more vigor, It will likely also work better on hardware that is not from 2018. At some point I will be upgrading to a RPI 5 to see if it runs better, If you are getting freezing issues I would recommend only running the VT only version for now.

## Future Updates!

- To Be Determined!!!
- Will add more features and functions to do with detection or extensions upon majority request!
